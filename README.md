# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-NN

This model is trained on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset that has 569 data with 30 features each. The model is a simple neural network with input layer, one hidden middle layer and an output layer. The activation function used at the middle layer is relu and the output layer is sigmoid. The optimizer used is Adam and sparse categorical cross entropy is used to measure loss. Metrics focus is on accuracy.Number of epochs is 10. Before standardising the data the accuracy was 81% and now prediction accuracy is 97%
